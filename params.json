{"name":"Github-LiveMarkdown","tagline":"A userscript that adds live Markdown preview to GitHub for comments/issues/etc.","body":"# Live Markdown Preview for GitHub\r\n\r\n**Live Markdown Preview for GitHub** is a userscript that does exactly what it says on the tin: It adds a live preview underneath the markdown input in comments, issues, etc. It's enabled by default, updates in realtime and can be toggled on and off with a button in the text area.\r\n\r\n![Demonstration](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3596343/523374/4fe1218a-c0b0-11e2-8b0a-82f0072ef3de.gif)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install a userscript implementation.\r\n  * **Chrome:** [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)\r\n  * **Firefox:** [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)\r\n  * **Opera:** See [documentation.](http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/) *(Untested)*\r\n  * **Safari:** [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) *(Untested)*\r\n2. Download the userscript [**here.**](https://raw.github.com/Daiz-/GitHub-LiveMarkdown/master/script.min.user.js)\r\n\r\nYou can also install the script to Chrome directly by saving the `.user.js` file to your hard drive and dragging & dropping it to your Extensions page.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Features\r\n\r\nRight now Live Preview doesn't work in commit line notes nor in Zen Mode. It also lacks support for some GitHub-specific things like @mentions, #XXX issue links and checkboxes. These are all planned features and should be implemented eventually.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
