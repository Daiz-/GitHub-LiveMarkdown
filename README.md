# Live Markdown Preview for GitHub

This is a userscript that does exactly what it says on the tin: It adds a live preview underneath the markdown input in comments, issues, etc. A picture says more than a thousand words:

The Live Preview is enabled by default, updates in realtime and can be toggled on and off with the button in the text area.

## Upcoming Features

Right now Live Preview doesn't work in commit line notes nor in Zen Mode. It also lacks support for some GitHub-specific things like @mentions, #XXX issue links and checkboxes. These are all planned features and should be implemented eventually.
